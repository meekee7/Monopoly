 * $Log: /Projects - 1999/Mono 2/Rule.cpp $
 * 
 * 56    10/20/99 1:16p Davide
 * when playing on a custom board, the DISPLAY_state.city flag is set to
 * -1. This greatly affected the display of deeds, cards and sound files
 * for versions other than USA.  A small check is now made. If
 * DISPLAY_state.city is -1, a temp variable is used instead and it is set
 * to iLandId-2.
 * 
 * 55    10/19/99 1:03p Russellk
 * Modified so loading a game will set the next dice roll to 0 indicating
 * reroll the dice
 * 
 * 54    10/07/99 5:31p Philla
 * host/ai bug last one???
 * 
 * 53    10/05/99 3:33p Philla
 * New function for detecting "prompt" message type.
 * 
 * 52    29/09/99 1:43p Agmsmith
 * Now send a 4 byte unique network ID of the original sender along with
 * every chat message, so you can determine the sending computer (not just
 * player).
 *
 * 51    28/09/99 2:26p Agmsmith
 * Avoid array overflow when sending game status to the lobby.
 *
 * 50    99/09/28 2:21p Timp
 * No more extern
 *
 * 49    23/09/99 4:25p Agmsmith
 * Only option when failed last roll for getting out of jail is to pay
 * cash, exclude the get out of jail card.
 *
 * 48    23/09/99 2:21p Agmsmith
 * Don't have a housing shortage prompt when only one player can buy,
 * since the text for notifying the other players that one player is
 * getting the last few houses doesn't exist for Monopoly 2000.
 *
 * 47    23/09/99 1:06p Agmsmith
 * Changed get out of jail rules to match the official rules - roll up to
 * 3 times and if you fail to get doubles on the last roll, it will ask
 * you again if you want to pay or use the card.
 *
 * 46    99/09/22 7:36p Timp
 * Fixed accept/reject sounds.
 *
 * 45    9/22/99 5:24p Davide
 * modified the notifyplayer message in the actionsetgamestate function
 * to pass an extra parameter that will determine if the game is
 * restarting
 * because of a loaded game or a new game
 *
 * 44    22/09/99 4:55p Agmsmith
 * Nothing.
 *
 * 43    22/09/99 4:24p Agmsmith
 * Get it working for Hotseat again.
 *
 * 42    9/22/99 3:50p Philla
 * Auction timing at beginning fixed.  Waits for everyone now before
 * the "going once" is issued.
 *
 * 41    9/21/99 6:26p Philla
 * Fixed having to click more than once on okay button in rules screen.
 *
 * 40    99/09/20 1:45p Timp
 * Fixed problem with garbage deed text.
 *
 * 39    9/17/99 4:11p Philla
 * Standard Rules button works in non-network and network mode.
 *
 * 38    99/09/17 1:05p Timp
 * Changed f/i handling.  (from player isn't checked)
 *
 * 37    9/12/99 1:20p Russellk
 * Set defaults correctly - cheats on only if hotkeys is defined as true.
 *
 * 36    9/08/99 3:39p Russellk
 *
 * 35    99/09/08 2:51p Agmsmith
 * Fix up pre-approval of config data to use network mode.
 *
 * 34    9/08/99 2:01p Philla
 * Fixed deadlock.  Can't okay rules and move on to game.
 *
 * 33    9/07/99 3:48p Philla
 * Live update of rules screen for non-host players.
 *
 * 32    99/09/02 5:23p Agmsmith
 * Let the lobby know the game status at appropriate times.
 *
 * 31    99/09/01 7:11p Agmsmith
 * Sending game status to the lobby under construction.
 *
 * 30    99/09/01 4:11p Agmsmith
 * Get Hotseat working again.
 *
 * 29    99/09/01 2:15p Timp
 * Support property name text for multiple cities
 *
 * 28    8/25/99 4:08p Philla
 * Latest version of Setup stuff.  New graphics.  Host only rules for
 * network...
 *
 * 27    8/12/99 9:20a Russellk
 * if defs used for Hotseat compatibility
 *
 * 26    8/09/99 12:11p Mikeh
 * Added function RULE_PlayersFirstMoveWasMade(int player) to
 * return players firstmove status.
 *
 * 25    7/21/99 10:16a Davide
 *
 * 24    7/16/99 3:15p Davide
 *
 * 23    7/05/99 3:26p Russellk
 * Adjusted to issue a phase refresh for collection phases using quicky
 * mortgage/sell feature (since with a BSSM lock it was automatic) to
 * allow detection that enough cash has been raised - take da money.
 *
 * 22    7/05/99 11:22a Russellk
 *
 * 21    7/02/99 6:01p Russellk
 * First pass alterations for BSSM state - numberD flags using a new
 * quicky mode (no lock required, works despite an existing lock).  Our
 * new interface is clunky with the old methods - repeatedly denying
 * requests - this method will correct that and let us leave the AI code
 * alone.
 *
 * 20    6/24/99 9:55a Davide
 *
 * 19    6/23/99 10:36a Davide
 * added a function call to reset the variables for the status screen when
 * restarting a game
 *
 * 18    6/22/99 11:16a Davide
 *
 * 17    6/21/99 3:52p Davide
 * added a member to the RULE_SquareInfoStruct to keep tabs on the total
 * game earnings for each square. The variable is incremented every time a
 * player lands on a square (CollectRent function)
 *
 * 16    5/27/99 3:31p Russellk
 * Removed old variable which made trades send only once - we only send
 * once now anyway, though AI's seem to have trouble now.  If so, they
 * need to be fixed as well - they seemed to send a trade edit done prior
 * to sending the trade items which might have worked with duplicates
 * being sent.
 *
 * 15    5/27/99 3:14p Russellk
 *
 * 14    5/26/99 8:44a Russellk
 * Offline trading operational, though some more testing would be
 * valuable.
 *
 * 13    5/21/99 3:55p Russellk
 * All initial trade function changed to non-locking
 *
 * 9     3/25/99 2:05p Russellk
 * OTIFY_FREE_UNMORTGAGING was sending messages with no property sets.
 * Fixed.
 *
 * 5     2/08/99 2:08p Russellk
 * Added DONE TURN support.
 *
 * 4     2/08/99 9:11a Russellk
 * Added state NOTIFY_TURN_END - a rather stupid end of turn
 * acknowledgement.  Useful for email monopoly, Hasbro wants it in at this
 * point.
 *
 * 3     1/28/99 4:07p Russellk
 * No restrictions on when new players join during phases
 *
 * 2     1/27/99 10:59a Russellk
 * Basic Mono2 display and user interface operational - no trade editor
 * nor game config editory.
 *
 * 1     1/08/99 2:06p Russellk
 *
 * 1     1/08/99 11:35a Russellk
 * Graphics
 *
 * 6     1/04/99 1:20p Russellk
 * Include file change for gameinc.h
 *
 * 5     1/04/99 11:39a Russellk
 * Game state restore added to log, excessive immunity notification at
 * player bankrupt fixed (Alex)
 *
 * 4     12/24/98 11:41a Russellk
 * Don't send useless immunity changes during bankruptcy.
 *
 * 3     12/18/98 10:03a Russellk
 * Modified property array comments to Monopoly names
 *
 * 2     12/17/98 4:27p Russellk
 * Obsolete comments removed for new version.  Log file facility entered
 * in Mess.c to record phase and action/error message activity.
