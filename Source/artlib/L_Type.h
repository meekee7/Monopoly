 * Various standard things are defined in L_Type.h.  Depending on the target
 * system, some of them change internally, but you don't need to be aware of
 * it too much.  For example, strings are made of 16 bit characters on the PC
 * and 8 bit on the PSX.  See C_ArtLib.h for the controlling defines.

// UCP - Uncommon palette bitmap struct.  This is what a TAB gets converted
// to by TAB2UCP.  Basically an 8 bit image with a native mode palette
// (palette converted to screen depth usage upon loading).
// 
// The palette seems to be interleaved with native bits at even indices and
// the corresponding alpha at odd indices.  The palette entries are BGR0 in
// increasing byte order in the file before conversion to native, which
// means blue in the low byte of an Intel format DWORD, then green, then
// red and zero in the high byte.  The alpha entries are in the low byte of
// a DWORD, in memory you see an alpha byte followed by 3 zeroes.  To save
// on computation, only 17 different alpha values are distinguished, see
// the ALPHA_* defines below (you can use other values, but the low bits
// will be dropped because it looks up the alpha in a table and calls a
// routine for each particular alpha value, rather than doing the multiply
// each time).  Also, the palette colours are pre-multiplied by the alpha
// value to save runtime computation (so a 50% transparent red has a RGB
// entry of (127,0,0) rather than the 255,0,0 that you would expect).
// 
// Colour index zero is always fully transparent.  If the index is < nAlpha
// then its alpha value is used for controling the level of transparency.
// If the 8 bit pixel index is >= nAlpha then it is drawn as solid colour.
// 
// The OriginOffset is used for showing where this particular bitmap is in
// the bigger mostly transparent bitmap that the whole animation is drawn
// in (think of it as being the size of the sheet of paper that was used by
// the artist to draw the cartoon and our TAB being the sub-rectangle part
// which all the actual pencil markings fit in).
